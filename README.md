## Features

- **Microcontroller Control**: The board is equipped with a microcontroller to manage and control input to the IC under assessment.

- **Analog Switches**: Analog switches, controlled by the microcontroller, regulate input to the IC for precise testing.

- **SMA Connectors**: SMA connectors are used for external inputs, ensuring efficient high-frequency signal exchange.

- **JTAG Connector**: A JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) connector is provided for programming and configuring the microcontroller.

- **Minimized User Intervention**: The board is designed to minimize user intervention and is intended to be placed inside a Faraday cage for a controlled testing environment.
